# Example program demonstrating labels and jump commands
# This program prints numbers in a loop

VAR num = 1
VAR three = 3
VAR one = 1

start: LOAD num # Load number into accumulator
OUT num # Print the number
ADD one # Add 1 to accumulator
STORE num # Store incremented value back

LOAD three # Load the limit (3)
SUB num # Subtract num (3 - num)
TEST loop # If result is negative (num > 3), jump to loop

JUMP start # Otherwise, jump back to start and continue

loop: HALT # Stop when done
